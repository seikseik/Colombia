        Abiayala is the word various indigenous Colombian peoples use to refer to America. In the Guna language, Abiayala translates as ‘bleeding land’. For the 100-plus autochthonous peoples living in Colombia today, inhabiting the American continent means surviving the wounds: once those of the Spanish conquest, today those inflicted by the violence of the narcotraffickers, the parastatal military apparatuses, and the large oil and gold multinationals.
        </p>
        <p fade>Nowadays, Colombian indigenous communities constitute a conglomerate of 115 ethnic groups, whose age-old traditions are struggling to adapt to contemporary urgencies.
In 2009, the Constitutional Court of Colombia denounced the fact that the armed conflict is endangering the survival of more than 30 autochthonous ethnic groups. Their ancestral territories have been transformed into military camps or fields for the extensive production of coca, opium poppy and marihuana. </p>

However, they have not improved conditions in rural areas with an indigenous majority. In regions such as Cauca, Chocó and Nariño, armed dissident groups and paramilitary organisations are rampant They control the country's peripheral territories through systematic violence against any dissident voices.</p>
        <p fade>It is no coincidence that, since the agreements were signed, Colombia has become the country with the highest number of murders of human rights defenders in the world: at the end of 2020, the count had exceeded one thousand victims in four years.</p>

        <p fade>Such is the case of the 240,000 people who make up the Nasa population in the heart of the Colombian Andes. For some years now, the Nasa have been applying an organised strategy to defend their land from violent invasion by drug traffickers, armed groups and multinational sugar cane companies. However, while in some areas the Nasa community is succeeding in the delicate task of preventing any outside interference in their territories, in other areas the population is succumbing to the armed invasions of the narco-traffickers. ▲</p>

        <i>Ciudad perdida.</i> The lost city. This is how the rural area of Toribío, in the foothills of the Cordillera Central of the Colombian Andes, is called. The name <i>Ciudad perdida</i> comes from the uncanny visual effect provided by the mountains that surround the village. Everyday, at dusk, hundreds of hectares of marihuana fields light up at the same time, revealing the hidden face of the silent Andean sunsets: a veritable lost city.

        </p>
        <p fade>The <i>constellations</i>, as some inhabitants of Toribìo call them, are nothing more than illegal, highly productive plantations, supported by a complex electrical system that is activated every night to accelerate the growth process of the plants.</p>

    <div class="text-container">

        <p fade>The energy for the thousands of lamps distributed along the Cordillera is diverted from the electricity network of the population of Toribío, whose urban centre suffers prolonged blackouts every week. They are necessary to meet the demand of the narcos, who provide the plants with 12 hours of artificial lighting every night. This enables them to maintain a very intense harvesting rhythm, making Toribío the largest marihuana production site in Colombia.

        </p>
        <p fade>In addition to dominating the world cocaine market, Colombia shares control of the marihuana trade in South America with Paraguay. The low prices of the Toribío's Creepy quality attract middlemen from the major Latin American cartels on a daily basis. They export marihuana in bulk by land to Ecuador, Chile and Venezuela, and by sea to Costa Rica and several Caribbean islands.</p>

        <p fade>Our journey begins right here, in Toribío, in south-western Colombia. We are in the heart of the Cauca region, one of the main crossroads of violence in the country’s history. The few hours by bus that separate Toribío from the city of Cali reveal the living memories of the endless war between the Colombian state and the guerrillas: murals signed by armed groups on house walls, traces of attacks and shootings in urban centres, huge expanses of coca and marihuana plantations. The significant deployment of military forces in the valleys surrounding Toribío, unparalleled in Colombia, does not lessen the feeling of absolute state neglect.
        </p>
        <p fade>Moving up the mountain, military posts give way to the checkpoints of FARC dissidents, who in recent years have violently ousted the self-managed checkpoints of local communities. Near Toribío, the slopes of the Andes are dotted with sativa and, to a lesser extent, coca crops. It is the FARC dissidents themselves who run Colombia's largest marihuana production site. But how did they manage to impose themselves on the local population?</p>

        <p fade>Until a few decades ago, Toribío was the beating heart of Nasa's indigenous culture. In 1971, the municipality hosted the foundation of CRIC, Colombia's first indigenous organisation. During the 1980s, CRIC led the Nasa community in the recovery of tens of thousands of hectares of ancestral lands, which later became partially autonomous regions (Resguardos) managed by traditional indigenous authorities. Among the recovered lands was Toribío. Today, a bittersweet air of defeat pervades the Andean village. The ambitions of full autonomy and the stability of the local Nasa government are fragmenting due to yet another armed invasion — drug traffickers and dissident FARC guerrillas have taken control of the territory for some years now.
        </p>
        <p fade>Due to its military strategic location, Toribío has been facing invasions by guerrilla groups, the national army and paramilitary organisations for decades. According to CNMH data, Toribío was the municipality most affected by armed attacks during Colombia's internal conflict, culminating in the FARC car bomb that destroyed the entire urban centre on 9 July 2011. I speak about this with a group of young people who accompany me to a small promontory near the village: ‘Until a few years ago you couldn’t even imagine sitting here’ — they say, as they recall the day of the attack.</p>
        <p fade>‘It was a Saturday morning — they said — and it all started with a burst of gunfire, from the mountains towards the town. As always, even though they didn't usually fire on Saturdays, because there were many people around. But since by then we were all used to it, people stayed outside anyway’.</p>

        <p fade>These were Toribío's darkest years. The militarisation of Cauca during the governments of Álvaro Uribe (2002 → 2010) had turned the town into a daily death scene, where civilians — caught in the crossfire between the army and the FARC — lived in constant fear of making a misstep. In an obsessive hunt for guerrilla groups, the mere fact of living in a FARC-controlled area turned natives and farmers into enemies of the state.

The vicious practice of <i>falsos positivos</i> had begun: the dirty arm of the army dressed every murdered civilian in a guerrilla uniform, so as to satisfy the demands of the highest government officials for the physical elimination of as many subversives as possible.

They are seen by the youngsters who fill the football pitch in the town of Toribío every evening. They are seen by all the locals, who are already plagued by the dull sound of rifles that has been accompanying their Andean nights for decades, and are now addicted to the night lights and the intense smell of marihuana that permeates every corner of the village.</p>
        <p fade>The plantations can also be seen from the camps of the guerrilla groups.

Through the extortion of vacuna, the Dagoberto Ramos group has fostered an immense illicit trade, which ensures the production of over 1,300 tons of marihuana per year. The trade is profitable both for the armed groups and the Nasa farmers who have chosen to give up the traditional cultivation of potatoes, beans, corn and coffee for the more profitable <i>mota</i> — marihuana.</p>

The disharmony caused by drug trafficking to the Nasa's traditional model of society has led local indigenous governors to repeatedly attempt to oppose the presence of illicit crops. This provoked a deep conflict with guerrilla groups — as shown by the dispute over territory that emerges in the many war murals that colour the region's streets.</p>

        <p fade>The Neehwe'sx — the six ancestral authorities of each autonomous territory — and the <i>Guardias indígenas</i> — community members in charge of maintaining ‘harmony’ in the area — still refuse to use weapons. However, since 2018, they have intensified actions to arrest members of armed groups, as well as public denunciations regarding the problem of illicit crops. While the cries for help have gone unheeded by the state apparatus, the violent response of the Dagoberto Ramos guerrillas has been quick to follow. Between 2018 and 2021, dozens of attacks, armed assaults, massacres and kidnappings were carried out against the ancestral authorities and the inhabitants of Toribío who opposed the presence of the plantations.</p>
        <p fade>The most ferocious attack is certainly the one carried out on the morning of 29 October 2019. Local governor Cristina Bautista, a Nasa indigenous woman who was highly critical of the marihuana plantations, was travelling by car to Toribío from the nearby village of Tacueyó. Dozens of members of the Dagoberto Ramos blocked the road on which she was travelling and attacked the car with rifles, killing Cristina and the four Guardias indígenas who were escorting her. The guerrillas took over the street, shooting at anyone who approached the bodies, including the ambulance. The people who were passing by, terrified, jumped down the surrounding cliffs to take cover, seriously injuring themselves.</p>

        <p fade>Toribío's recent history is full of similar episodes. The Dagoberto Ramos guerrillas continue to recruit local youth, expanding their military and economic power every day. At the same time, they threaten anyone who opposes their land management plans.</p>
        <p fade>Until a few months ago, Father Ezio Roattino — a missionary and priest of the Toribío community — had been fighting against drug trafficking in the municipality together with the ancestral authorities and part of the community. Due to health problems, Father Ezio returned to Italy in the summer of 2021, after more than forty years spent defending the Nasa people's right to life, peace and land. ‘He came here with a Catholic mission, but he has become more Nasa than us,’ local people say.</p>
        <p fade>Father Ezio's story is the story of Colombia. During the 1990s, the priest had to flee to Toribío from the neighbouring village of Caldono after being persecuted and threatened with death by a paramilitary group linked to the Colombian police. They accused him of having granted a funeral to a guerrilla. In Toribío, Father Ezio became a leading figure for the Nasa community. When the security of the population was in danger, he often intervened personally to interrupt armed actions by the army or guerrilla groups. When he speaks, Ezio has the pace and tone of someone who knows every secret of an armed conflict that has no equal on the continent in terms of duration and atrocity. ▲ </p>

        ‘It’s not the first time that narcos have tried to enter Pioyá. Today is different, though. The monster has grown bigger. We’ll never let them in. Years ago, Toribío was the heart of the Nasa resistance, but today it’s no longer, because it’s fallen into the hands of the drug traffickers. Today, the heart of the NASA resistance is Pioyá,’ says Constanza, a Nasa indigenous woman who has been fighting for decades the presence of drug trafficking in these ancestral territories. Her words tell the story of the two faces of the mountains inhabited by the community.
        </p>
        <p fade>While near Toribío the Andes light up every night to signal the presence of the crops managed by the narco-guerrillas, on the less travelled peaks of Pioyá, at an altitude of about 3,000 metres, the Nasa population is succeeding in preventing the armed groups from entering the territory — thanks to the extraordinary collective organisation of the <i>Guardia indígena</i>.</p>
        <p fade>How can a group equipped only with walkie talkies and traditional sticks succeed in blocking access to narco-criminals in possession of military weapons? In order to understand this, we need to analyse the past once again. In the elementary schools of the Cauca Mountains, the history of America is taught starting from the great cycles of resistance of the Andean peoples. The Nasa settled in the most inaccessible areas of the Cordillera Central 500 years ago, when the Spanish invasion forced them to flee from the fertile valleys of Cauca and scatter among the less hospitable Andean slopes of the Cordillera, with its harsh climate and scarcely cultivable land.</p>

        <p fade>In spite of the geo-climatic difficulties, the Nasa communities — unlike other local indigenous peoples — have been able to maintain their linguistic and cultural roots over the intervening centuries: almost half of the Nasa population still speaks Nasa Yuwe, the pre-Hispanic autochthonous language.</p>
        <p fade>Moreover, in three hundred years of conquest and settlement, the Nasa have perfected a series of techniques to defend their territory in a collective and organised manner from invasion. The memorable battles of Cacica Gaitana against the Spanish conqueror Sebastián de Belalcázar, or the clashes between the <i>cacique</i> Juan Tama de la Estrella and the Spanish crown, are just some of the episodes that punctuate the community's history of resistance.

        <p fade>The difficult period of (non) integration into the newly independent Colombian state during the 19th century, combined with cultural interference from the Catholic Church — which forbade the use of the indigenous language and the practice of traditional rituals — weakened Nasa community’s solidity until the 1970s, when the indigenous communities of Cauca reorganised themselves in response to the need to recover their ancestral lands and free them from invaders.
</p>
        <p fade>In those years, the national army and various parastatal bodies took advantage of the ‘guerrilla hunt’ to brutally repress any kind of peaceful mobilisation of the Nasa communities. Nowadays, Nasa’s primary need has remained the recognition of political autonomy in their own territories, still partially occupied by the large sugar cane multinationals, armed groups and drug traffickers.

        <p fade>While in areas such as Toribío the tradition of resistance is gradually giving way to narco-culture, in many other localities populated by the Nasa — including Pioyá — the link with ancestral forms of defending the autonomy of the territory is still strong, reinvigorated by the preservation of the <i>Nasa Yuwe</i> language and mythical-ritual traditions.</p>

        <p fade>Among these, the so-called <i>Minga</i> has become extremely important. It was inherited from the Quechua language (‘mink'a’ means ‘group work for the common good’), and it indicates a collective action in which each person makes a personal effort for the benefit of community integrity. <i>Mingas</i> are generally convened by the ancestral authorities, and can be held to build an infrastructure, organise a protest or encourage a shared reflection on a common problem — this is the case of the so-called <i>Mingas de pensamiento</i>.
</p>
        <p fade>In accordance with the <i>Minga</i> and the cardinal principle of non-violence, in 2001 the Nasa indigenous people formed the so-called <i>Guardia Indígena</i>: an autonomous organisation for territorial control composed of almost the entire young male population and various women from their respective territories.
</p>
        <p fade>The <i>Guardias Indígenas</i> are recognisable by their blue uniforms and are equipped with a walkie talkie and a <i>vara de mando</i>: the stick that traditionally symbolises the deep relationship with the Nasa territory.

        <p fade>Thanks to a dense network of checkpoints and effective walkie-talkie communications, the <i>Guardias Indígenas</i> manage to organise a strict and constant surveillance of every area of territories such as Pioyá. As soon as an armed person is spotted, the Guard involves the entire population via walkie talkie. Immediately, the community arrives in groups of hundreds, in order to bring the member of the armed group to justice.</p>
        <p fade>In Pioyá, the surveillance system of the <i>Guardias Indígenas</i> has repeatedly allowed the population to stop the invasion of drug trafficking in the bud, not without human losses.
</p>
        <p fade>An episode from 2018, recounted by a coordinator of the <i>Guardia Indígena</i> of Pioyá, shows the extent of the community's effort to defend its territory: ‘The community was informed that the narcos had gone up the mountain. It was midnight. Ten of us went out. We managed to catch them up. <i>Guardias</i> kept coming to support us. We went from 10 to 5,000. In the morning we caught the narcos. They had rifles, four grenades and 375 bullets. We sentenced them according to our autonomous court, then we destroyed their weapons. This cost us further threats: each rifle costs 12-14 million pesos (about 3,000 euros), and there were seven of them. But this is the only way Pioyá can continue to be a territory of coexistence, peace and resistance’.

        <p fade>In addition to combating the circulation of arms, the Pioyá community has decided to use an iron fist against marihuana and coca crops. Any plant that funds drug trafficking is immediately uprooted by the community, through collective actions in which plantations — together with cocaine refineries — are physically destroyed. As a result, Pioyá is one of the very few territories in the Cauca region where illicit crops are completely absent.</p>
        <p fade>A few months ago, in the neighbouring Caldono lands, one of these actions cost a violent attack on the community by a group of armed narcos — affiliated to the Dagoberto Ramos dissident group. On 20 April 2021, narcos killed in an ambush Sandra Liliana Peña Chocué, a Nasa indigenous authority that had been in the front line against the presence of coca and marihuana crops. Two days later, on 22 April 2021, the community organised a <i>Minga de Control Territorial</i> to commemorate the dead governor.</p>
        <p fade>Among the activities organised in her memory, a collective action was planned in the morning to destroy the coca crops that funded the drug trade. While hundreds of people were uprooting the coca plants, members of the narcomafia arrived and attacked the indigenous population with machine guns: 32 Nasa were wounded. In response, the community chased the armed group with its own vehicles. They managed to block the trucks in which the narcos were going away and captured twelve of them. They were then subjected to ancestral justice. The harshest sentences resulted in 60 years’ imprisonment for the murder of Governor Sandra Liliana Peña Chocué. </p>

        <p fade>The Colombian state hasn’t been able to stem the constant intimidation by armed groups, which today are imposing the monopoly of violence on indigenous territories. Nonetheless, the resistance of Pioyá continues with the means at its disposal: ancestral justice, strategies of unarmed defence of the territory and a great sense of community. The ultimate reason for this battle is explained by Vilma Almendra, a Nasa-Misak writer: ‘I am a daughter of the Nasa and Misak people. Our tradition has been forged by thousands of years of resistance. Traditionally, we saw our land as our Mother. In recent times, they’ve been trying to subjugate us [...], some of us have lost this maternal bond with our land, but still fight against its transformation into a market. We must resist this process’. </p>
        <p fade>The community stories of resistance to drug trafficking are still exceptional cases. They are in contrast to a process of cultural and political weakening of the indigenous Nasa communities that seems to go beyond the mere implementation of narcomafias’ strategies. Where it is not the narcos and guerrillas that control the territory with violence, it is then the paramilitary groups, the national army, the multinationals acting as landowners. An armed conflict that continues to haunt the darkest suburbs of Colombia, where stories like that of Pioyá are overshadowed by the lethal and unstoppable expansion of <i>Lost Cities</i> like Toribío. ▲</p>
